<p>In the aftermath of Hegel's systematic rationalism, however, continental thinkers grew increasingly dissatisfied with totalizing metaphysics. Existentialists like Kierkegaard and Nietzsche revolted against Hegel's submerging of the existing individual within the dynamics of an impersonal rational process. Privileging subjective passion over objective knowledge, they viewed idealism's conceptual edifices as authoritarian artifacts that alienated human beings from their concrete freedom and finite historicity. Their writings helped inaugurate the existential, hermeneutic, and phenomenological tendencies that came to dominate 20th century European philosophy.</p>
<p>Kierkegaard, often deemed the "father of existentialism," mounted a withering critique of Hegelian idealism's disdain for the passion and paradox of subjective inwardness. He believed the universal abstractions of speculative reason failed to capture the singularity and paradoxicality of spiritual existence as appropriated by the existing individual. For Kierkegaard, truth is a subjective passion continually re-enacted through the infinite personal investment of inwardness rather than a complete metaphysical system to be systematically unfolded. His pseudonymous writings articulated dimensions of human existence—dread, melancholy, anxiety, despair—that he felt were eliminated or rationalized away by the self-satisfied complacencies of Hegel's Science of Logic.</p>
<p>Nietzsche, too, scorned the Hegelian cooption of humanity's spiritual condition within an optimistic, pan-logistic process. The "death of God" prophesied in his writings signaled the modern waning of ultimate metaphysical sanction from human existence and values. Condemning Platonism's anti-natural denigration of the bodily and sensuous, Nietzsche sought to reinstantiate the enhancing and intensifying passions within a "revaluation of all values." His portrayal of subjectivity as irreducibly perspectival and interpretive announced the hermeneutic and genealogical tendencies that marginalized systematic ontology and epistemology in postmodern thought.</p>
<h3>The Hermeneutic Tradition</h3>
<p>Nietzsche's perspectivist repudiation of the "God's eye view" reflected a broader hermeneutic turn in Western philosophy. Thinkers like Heidegger, Gadamer, and Ricoeur held that human beings do not enjoy a vantage point of pure detachment outside the preconceptions and prejudices inherited from their historically situated traditions and linguistic practices. Rather than pursuing an impossible retreat to the "view from nowhere," they advocated embracing our radical finitude and beginning from the interpretive circle of understanding and being-in-the-world.</p>
<p>For Heidegger, the human mode of being is not the self-certainty of the Cartesian subject but <i>Dasein</i>, the concrete existing being who finds itself already thrown into a world of ineluctable facticity and preconceptual involvement. Dasein never encounters beings in their pristine presence but always by way of practical interpretation through a fore-structured hermeneutic situation. Its very perception of objects is interpretively circumscribed by its absorbed immersion within the meaningfully disclosed world of its pre-ontological understanding.</p>
<p>Gadamer positioned philosophical hermeneutics as the perpetual dialectic between the expectations projected from our prejudiced standpoint and the testing encounter with what is meaningfully other or alien. Genuine understanding occurs not through the impossible transcendence of our historical and linguistic conditionedness, but through the continuous fusion of horizons between the past's accredited meanings and the critic's situated re-interpretation. On this view, texts and traditions are inexhaustible reservoirs for the unlimited disclosure of new meaning through the dialogical interplay of question and answer. All comprehension essentially involves the application of inherited prejudices in a transformative re-appropriation.</p>
The Critique of Pure Reason, by Immanuel Kant, is one of the most influential works in the history of philosophy. Published in 1781, it is a treatise which seeks to show the inability of reason to establish the existence of God, free will, and the immortality of the soul. Kant's goal was to delimit reason's boundaries so as to posit a "metaphysics of experience" that would harmonize with the traditional religious truths of Christianity.
Kant did this by drawing a fundamental distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions. Analytic propositions are those whose predicates are wholly contained within the subject concept: for example, "all bodies are extended." Synthetic propositions, on the other hand, are those that predicate something not contained in the subject concept: for example, "all bodies are heavy." Analytic propositions, Kant argued, articulate only the logical relationship between concepts and are thereby tautological; their opposite would be self-contradictory. Synthetic propositions, however, are real additions to our knowledge, since their predicates are not already contained in their subject concepts.
According to Kant, all synthetic a posteriori judgments—that is, those judgments that cannot be validated simply through examination of the concepts involved but require some empirical observation—are contingent and particular. They cannot be universally necessary and apodictic. He sought to find another class of judgments that would be synthetic but not empirical, a priori rather than a posteriori. He found these in Mathematics and subsequently in the fundamental principles of natural science. These a priori synthetic judgments, according to Kant, are possible because the forms of our sensibility—space and time—are transcendentally ideal. They are not really objective features of the noumenal world but only a priori forms of our subjective capacity for intuition. It is for this reason that mathematics and physics, being grounded in space and time, have universal and necessary truths.
The synthetic a priori judgments that compose mathematics and physics are possible only because they are derived from the pure intuitions of space and time. But reason, Kant argued, does not have access to pure intuitions and therefore cannot formulate synthetic a priori judgments. Reason labors instead with concepts only. This sharply demarcates the limits of reason's legitimate use, confining it to the phenomenal realm of sensibility and categorically denying its ability to conclude anything regarding supersensible or noumenal reality. Reason's attempt to achieve metaphysical knowledge is an illusion, according to Kant, because the objects of metaphysical inquiry—God, freedom, immortality—transcend the boundaries of all possible experience. These objects are forever beyond the capacities of reason, which is structurally limited and inherently incapable of thinking them.
Kant's solution to the metaphysical rationalism of the Enlightenment was to claim the phenomenal world as the proper domain of reason and to restrict its inquiries to the objects of possible experience. The a priori conditions of sensibility dictate the necessary form but not the contingent content of experience. Space and time, as pure intuitions of sensibility, are the a priori conditions under which alone objects can be given to us. But these objects are still appearances, not things-in-themselves. They are phenomena, whose form is constituted by the subjective structures of the mind but whose matter or content is received a posteriori through sensory affection. The forms of thought or categories of the understanding, on the other hand, constitute the rules by which the sensory manifold is synthesized into objects of experience. But the understanding's categories, like the intuitions of sensibility, are restricted in their employment to the limited domain of phenomena.
This argument represents the distinctive achievement of Kant's Copernican Revolution, which proposed that the objects of experience must conform to our modes of perception rather than our modes of perception conforming to the objects. We do not have access to things-in-themselves, which must forever remain unknown to us, but only to things-as-they-appear, which must conform to the a priori spatiotemporal and intellectual conditions of all possible experience. This was Kant's celebrated solution to the problem of metaphysics, which had embroiled philosophy in fruitless dogmatism. By limiting the bounds of reason to the conditions of possible experience, Kant believed he had secured the future of empirical science while undermining the pretensions of traditional metaphysics.
Reason is still permitted its regulative employment, according to Kant, whereby it formulates ideas of reason that can never be constitutive of objects but serve only as heuristic fictions that guide our theoretical and practical pursuits. The theological idea of God, the cosmological idea of the totality of the world, and the psychological idea of the soul are seen by Kant as such fictions. They are not real objects of knowledge but merely necessary ideas demanded by the metaphysical impulse of reason itself. Reason demands that the contingent be explained by the unconditioned, and projects the ideas of God, world, and soul as this unconditioned ground. But reason transgresses its own boundaries when it fallaciously converts these ideas into constitutive principles for determining the existence of real objects.
Kant's transcendental idealism sought to resolve the impasse of modern philosophy by cordoning off the phenomenal world as reason's proper domain while consigning the noumenal realm to the limbo of the unknowable. It was an audacious and immensely influential attempt to define the limits of human knowledge in order to make metaphysics scientifically permissible. Kant accomplished this by radically altering the traditional correspondence theory of truth in order to reconceive objects as conforming to the mind rather than the mind conforming to objects. The phenomenal world becomes appearance, but appearance to which the mind necessarily and unavoidably conforms. Such a revolution in philosophy eventually precipitated the linguistic turn that dominated 20th century thought. But it first secured the integrity of the modern natural sciences while marking an epoch in the collapse of rationalist metaphysics.
While Kant's transcendental idealism circumscribed the limits of theoretical reason, his moral philosophy sought to establish the authority of practical reason. The Critique of Practical Reason, published in 1788, aimed to define an unchanging and unconditional principle of morality based solely on the deliverances of reason itself. Kant rejected foundational principles drawn from human nature, the laws of God, or the dictates of social utility, since all these were contingent and relative rather than universal and necessary. Only reason's own intrinsic principle could serve as the categorical imperative for moral conduct.
This supreme principle of practical reason is the injunction to "act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law." Moral behavior must be motivated by duty rather than inclination, and its binding force derives not from any consideration of desired effects but solely from reason's own legislative will. The good will is thus the only thing with intrinsic moral worth, and it expresses its freedom through the autonomous embrace of rationally willed moral maxims. Reason's moral law is objective and formal rather than grounded in subjective desires or empirical facts about human nature. It furnishes a decision procedure for adjudicating potential maxims by testing whether they could be universally willable without contradiction.
Kant argued that free rational agency presupposes the postulates of God, freedom, and immortality, since a system of perfect concordance between virtue and happiness could only be effected through divine governance in an eternal life to come. Though these postulates could never be theoretically proven, they are pragmatically necessary for the viability of the moral life, which has its inviolable roots in the autonomy of practical reason. Kant labeled this overarching system "the moral law within me and the starry heavens above me," conjoining the moral vocation of reason with nature's sublime magnitude.
While opening the way for future idealistic philosophies of freedom, Kant's moral theory has been profoundly influential in establishing the independence of ethical reasoning from empirical facts and in locating moral value solely in the inherent quality of the will rather than in its anticipated consequences. The autonomy of practical reason became the cornerstone for the primacy of individual rights and human dignity that has characterized liberal political thought since the Enlightenment.
Though Kant's theoretical philosophy may have undermined traditional metaphysics, his moral theory firmly rooted ethics in inviolable, unconditional rational principles. This dualism between phenomena and noumena, nature and freedom, allowed Kant to reconcile science with morality at the cost of certifying the irreparable scission between theoretical and practical reason. While giving rise to unprecedented difficulties, it was an audacious attempt to resolve the modern crisis of reason by circumscribing its limits while vindicating its authority. Kant's radicalCopernican revolution irrevocably transformed the landscape of Western thought.
In the decades after Kant, German idealists sought to overcome his dualism between phenomena and noumena by demonstrating the metaphysical unity of thought and being. Figures like Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel believed Kant had stopped short in his critical philosophy by retaining the Cartesian split between mind and world. They aimed to push Kant's transcendental idealism toward an absolute idealism that would substantiate the identity of subject and object within an all-encompassing rational system.
Fichte contended that the pure Ego posits itself and the not-self in a single, originary act of self-consciousness. All reality is grounded in and derived from the Ego's radical freedom and spontaneous self-positing. For Schelling, nature is visible mind while mind is invisible nature, two complementary aspects of the infinite Absolute that underlies and unifies them. And Hegel famously claimed that the rational is the real - that reality precisely conforms to the dialectical unfolding of the Absolute Idea as it develops through a necessary series of successive negations toward perfect self-knowledge and concrete universality.
On Hegel's view, the understanding grasps the world in terms of fixed oppositions and antinomies: being/nothing, finite/infinite, phenomenon/noumenon. But these contraries are actually fluid moments within an perpetually dynamic process of transgression and sublation. The understanding's abstract either/ors are resolvable at a higher level of rationality that can grasp their concreteunity as complementary, interpenetrating aspects of an organic whole. All determinate beings are reconceived as moments within the ceaseless self-mediation of the Absolute as it infinitely differentiates and re-integrates itself through the cunning of reason.
This absolute idealism reached its culmination in Hegel, for whom reality is rationally structured through and through as the self-externalization of the logical Idea. The movement from logic to nature to spirit recapitulates the syllogistic development of the Absolute as it alienates itself into otherness and then recovers itself from that estranged objectivity. What is rational is actual and what is actual is rational, since the rational alone has genuine being and actuality is the self-manifesting expression of reason. All apparent contingencies and contradictions are inwardly superseded within the purposive unfolding of the Concept as it progressively discloses its complete self-determination.
Thoughenigmatic and systematically overambitious, Hegel's idealism represented a magnificent attempt to reconstitute the ruptured modern world within an all-embracing metaphysics of reason. By reconfiguring subjectivity and objectivity as complementary and coconstitutive, Hegel dispensed with Kant's problematic dividebetween phenomena and noumena in order to re-establish philosophy's promised land of conceptual totality and absolute knowledge. His titanic dialectic purported to resolve all dualisms and heal all scissions through reason's immanent self-unfolding.
In the aftermath of Hegel's systematic rationalism, however, continental thinkers grew increasingly dissatisfied with totalizing metaphysics. Existentialists like Kierkegaard and Nietzsche revolted against Hegel's submerging of the existing individual within the dynamics of an impersonal rational process. Privileging subjective passion over objective knowledge, they viewed idealism's conceptual edifices as authoritarian artifacts that alienated human beings from their concrete freedom and finite historicity. Their writings helped inaugurate the existential, hermeneutic, and phenomenological tendencies that came to dominate 20th century European philosophy.
